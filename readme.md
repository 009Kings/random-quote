# Random Quote Machine

We're going to use jQuery to make a webpage that displays a random quote.

##Requirements

* Make a webpage with a button
* Import the jQuery library using `<script></script>` tags
* When the button is clicked, generate a random quote and display it on the page using jQuery
  * Note that you'll want to store quotes in an array, and use `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to generate random array indicies.
  * See MDN for `Math.random` examples: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
* Every time the button is clicked, clear the page and replace it with a new random quote.


##Example

##Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Create your HTML page, and don't forget to include links to the CSS and JS files.
* Be creative! Both in your choice of quotes and styling. Think about all of those different CSS properties.
* As a bonus, add a form field and allow people to include their own quotes in your random generator.
